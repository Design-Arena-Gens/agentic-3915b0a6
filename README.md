# Agentic Workflow Builder

Design adaptive, automation-ready workflows in minutes. Provide intent, tools, and constraints — the agent synthesizes a detailed blueprint with steps, owners, guardrails, and success metrics you can export immediately.

## ✨ Core Capabilities

- **Agent-authored workflows** – Translate briefs into multi-step automation plans with rationale, tooling, and execution hints.
- **Interactive canvas** – Inspect each step's inputs, outputs, success criteria, and suggested automation approach.
- **Operational guardrails** – Auto-generated metrics, validation checkpoints, and escalation paths tailored to your brief.
- **One-click export** – Copy a complete JSON plan for handoff to builders, runbooks, or downstream scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Describe the outcome** – share triggers, desired impact, audiences, and constraints.
2. **Tune automation mode** – choose orchestration, co-pilot, or fully autonomous execution.
3. **Review the blueprint** – explore the generated step cards, owners, guardrails, and metrics.
4. **Export the plan** – copy the workflow JSON and plug it into your favorite automation stack.
